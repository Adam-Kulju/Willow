# Willow
A superhuman chess engine, written in C++. Current rating: ~2850 CCRL (estimated)

Willow has been tested on an Openbench server, and I have @cosmobobak, @uwuplant, @crippa1337, @archishou, @Ciekce, @JouanDeag, @GediminasMasaitis, @Alex2262, @lucametehau, @spamdrew128 and @dede1751 to thank for helping me test changes way easier than I would have otherwise been able to. They have also suggested various changes in Willow that have improved the strength of the engine dramatically.
